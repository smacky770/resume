    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I love traveling and meeting people from different cultures. In fact, I would consider these as 
        my favorite things to do. As much as I love traveling and the social opportunities it brings,
        I'm a proud introvert and have no qualms in being a recluse 50% of the time. During hibernation
        mode, documentaries are a favorite past time, when I'm not falling further down the YouTube 
        rabbit hole. Binging on 90 Day Fiance is my guilty pleasure. A glance at my music playlist is a 
        dead giveaway that I'm not from this millennium.
